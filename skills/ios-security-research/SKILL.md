# iOS Security Research — Orchestrator Skill

You are the orchestrator for an autonomous iOS security engagement. Use this skill when the user asks for iOS app reverse engineering, mobile API testing, bug-bounty work against an iOS target, or any workflow that combines runtime hooking with HTTP traffic analysis.

## Source-of-truth files

Read these first when a user starts an engagement. Their contents define how the platform behaves.

1. `docs/architecture.md` — module map and design constraints.
2. `docs/workflows.md` — the six engagement phases (bootstrap → passive → mapping → active → exploit → report) and what runs in each.
3. `docs/bug-bounty-modules.md` — IDOR, auth, mass assignment, tamper, GraphQL, token analysis — what each tests and how findings are emitted.
4. `docs/frida-objection-integration.md` — Frida hook library, Objection script library, and when to use each.
5. `docs/mcp-integration.md` — the vendored mitmproxy-mcp surface and the iOS-aware additions.
6. `skills/_upstream/anthropic-cybersecurity-skills/skills/reverse-engineering-ios-app-with-frida/SKILL.md` — procedural Frida reference.
7. `skills/_upstream/anthropic-cybersecurity-skills/skills/analyzing-ios-app-security-with-objection/SKILL.md` — procedural Objection reference.

## How to act

When the user describes an engagement, do this:

### Step 1 — confirm environment

```
lolmcp doctor
```

If anything fails: read `docs/roadmap.md` and follow the setup steps. Do not proceed until the doctor is clean.

### Step 2 — start the engagement

```
lolmcp run --target <bundle_id> --device <usb|id> --budget 1800
```

This calls `agent.runner.run_engagement`, which:

1. Spawns the target via Frida (`frida_layer.runner.FridaRunner`).
2. Starts the vendored mitmproxy-mcp (`mitm.client.MitmClient`).
3. Ingests events through `agent.correlate.Correlator` into `runs/<run_id>/`.
4. Ticks `agent.planner.Planner.next_step()` until the engagement is terminal.

The planner walks through phases automatically. You don't need to drive it step-by-step — but you do need to *watch the output*. Each step writes to `runs/<run_id>/state.json`.

### Step 3 — read findings

```
ls runs/<run_id>/findings/
cat runs/<run_id>/report.md
```

Summarize the findings for the user. Link to each finding's Markdown file. Group by severity. Quote a representative flow_id per finding so the user can `lolmcp replay <finding_id>` to confirm.

### Step 4 — drill in if needed

If the user wants to investigate a specific finding or endpoint:

- `lolmcp correlate <run_id>` — recompute correlations after tuning.
- `python -m api.idor --run-dir runs/<run_id> --baseline <flow_id>` — re-run a module on its own.
- Open the relevant Frida hook in `frida_layer/hooks/<hook>.js` and modify it; restart the engagement.

## Boundaries

- **Don't write throwaway code in chat.** Add hooks to `frida_layer/hooks/`, modules to `api/`, addons to `mitm/addons/`. Then invoke.
- **Don't modify `mitm/vendor/` or `skills/_upstream/` directly.** Patches go into the layer that wraps them (`mitm/addons/`, `mitm/client.py`, or our own SKILL.md wrappers).
- **Don't bypass correlation.** Findings without a correlated Frida event are weaker. If a module emits one without correlation, that's a signal something is wrong with the run.
- **Don't add a UI.** This platform is CLI + Claude Code only.

## Common requests and how to map them

| User says | You do |
|---|---|
| "Test this iOS app for IDORs" | `lolmcp run` with budget, then once mapping is done, `python -m api.idor --run-dir runs/<id> --baseline <flow_ids>` |
| "Check the auth on this endpoint" | Replay that specific flow with `api/auth.py` |
| "Decrypt the request body" | Look at `commoncrypto_tracer.js` events; if HMAC/AES seen, the input hash should match request body sha256 |
| "Bypass jailbreak detection" | `jailbreak_bypass.js` is loaded by default; if app still detects, look at `objection ios jailbreak disable` for the broader pattern set |
| "What does this method do" | `objection ios hooking watch class <X>` via `objection_layer.runner` |
| "Replay this request as user B" | `mitm.replay.ios.replay_as_ios(...)` with `set_headers` containing user_b's Authorization |

## Output expectations

Every engagement produces:

- `runs/<run_id>/frida_events.jsonl`
- `runs/<run_id>/mitm_flows.jsonl`
- `runs/<run_id>/correlations.jsonl`
- `runs/<run_id>/findings.jsonl`
- `runs/<run_id>/findings/<id>.{md,json}` for each finding
- `runs/<run_id>/report.md` + `report.json`

When summarizing for the user, link to each of these — they are the audit trail.
